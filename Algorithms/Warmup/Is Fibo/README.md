Is Fibo
===================

###Problem Statement###

You are given an integer, N. Write a program to determine if N is an element of the Fibonacci sequence.

The first few elements of the Fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,⋯. A Fibonacci sequence is one where every element is a sum of the previous two elements in the sequence. The first two elements are 0 and 1.

Formally: 

fib<sub>0</sub> = 0  
fib<sub>1</sub> = 1  
⋮  
fib<sub>n</sub> = fib<sub>n-1</sub> + fib<sub>n-2</sub> ∀n > 1

###Input Format###

The first line contains T, number of test cases. 
T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N.

###Constraints###

<pre>
1 ≤ T ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>
1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>10</sup>
</pre>

###Output Format###

Display `IsFibo` if N is a Fibonacci number and `IsNotFibo` if it is not. The output for each test case should be displayed in a new line.

###Sample Input###

```
3
5
7
8
```

###Sample Output###

```
IsFibo
IsNotFibo
IsFibo
```

###Explanation###

5 is a Fibonacci number given by fib<sub>5</sub> = 3+2  
7 is not a Fibonacci number  
8 is a Fibonacci number given by fib<sub>6</sub> = 5+3
